Austin Coding Academy is a part time coding bootcamp that is committed to affordable, accessible coding education. ACA offers full stack programs that are broken up into three levels: Intro, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level is a 10 week course that meets two nights a week. By the end of the Advanced class students are prepared for a full time position as a junior web developer.

Located in Austin, TX, the school is focused on providing an accessible, real world education designed to get people into a job as a developer, but without the financial challenges of having to take out a loan to pay for tuition or quit your job to attend class. Because classes are part time and in the evenings, they have the added benefit of being taught by instructors who work as full time developers during the day at companies like Continuum Analytics, General Motors, Invodo, and more. All instructors are trained through ACA's rigorous instructor development program that focuses on making sure instructors know more than how to build the technology; they know how to teach it as well.

Intro level classes are designed for beginners with no background in coding. Applications for each session are accepted on a rolling basis and can be submitted online.
