description: !!python/unicode 'Austin Coding Academy is a part time coding bootcamp
  that is committed to affordable, accessible coding education. ACA offers full stack
  programs that are broken up into three levels: Intro, Intermediate, and Advanced.
  Each level is a 10 week course that meets two nights a week. By the end of the Advanced
  class students are prepared for a full time position as a junior web developer.
  Because classes are part time and in the evenings, they have the added benefit of
  being taught by instructors who work as full time developers during the day at companies
  like Continuum Analytics, General Motors, Invodo, and more. All instructors are
  trained through ACA''s rigorous instructor development program that focuses on making
  sure instructors know more than how to build the technology; they know how to teach
  it as well.
