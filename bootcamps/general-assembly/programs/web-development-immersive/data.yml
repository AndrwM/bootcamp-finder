reviews:
- In the last few weeks, and as the material we’re learning has become more complex, I really recognize the value of excellent teaching, and a really rigorously produced curriculum.
- I’ve already learned so much in just one week! The instructional team is all sorts of encouraging and they’re always reminding us that we’re each on our own timeline for learning all of this.
- I could see the hunger for knowledge in my classmates eyes and it was inspiring and motivating. Every one was fully immersed into the coursework and hung on to every word from our instructor.
