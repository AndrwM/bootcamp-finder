description: !!python/unicode 'General Assembly offers Web Development Immersive class
  in 8 cities around the

  world. Unlike other bootcamps, GA''s curriculum spends some time focusing on CS

  topics like runtimes of algorithms and data structures. This is great for

  students who''ve learned a lot of syntax on their own, but need to get more

  knowledge of best practices in computing.


  They also provide job preparation from reviewing portfolios to verbal

  programming quizzes. Additionally, after the end of the course, they host a

  meet and greet with potential employers and also open applications to the GA

  apprenticeship program. The program is

  basically a 12 week paid apprenticeship with a tech company.


  To apply to the program, you first fill out an application online. You will

  then have an informational and fit phone interview. Afterwords, you will need

  to complete pre-work and have another interview. This interview will be more

  around skills including the pre-work and logic problems. This process might

  vary based on which city you plan on applying to.
