description: !!python/unicode 'Coding Dojo doesn''t want you to just learn a new programming
  language, they

  want you to learn how to learn (remember that adage about giving a fish vs.

  teaching fishing). They teach their students numerous languages because

  technology changes so frequently that the best skill they can teach you is how

  to adapt to those changes and be successful. In fact, they dedicate the first

  5 weeks to learning the fundamentals like database design and MVC frameworks

  with minimal programming language lessons.


  After the fundamentals section, you spend the next three weeks on JavaScript,

  three weeks on Ruby on Rails and the last week preparing you for after

  bootcamp including Demo Day. Demo Day is an opportunity for you to show off

  your projects to hiring partners and, hopefully, get an offer. Throughout the

  course, you should have created 3 (1 JavaScript, 2 Ruby on Rails) projects to

  demonstrate on Demo Day.


  On a day to day basis, expect to spend most of your time coding. At the end of

  each topic, you will show your mastery through a qualifying exam. These exams

  are used to earn "belts" organized much like the karate system. There are five

  belt levels including an optional black belt level.


  There are also some great perks to the program including FREE FOOD! You do

  have to find your own housing, but they will connect you with other classmates

  to help you find roommates.


  To apply, just go online and fill out their application and send in your

  resume. If you are a good fit, they will schedule a phone or Skype interview

  with you. While they don''t require a computer science or programming

  background, applicants without one should be able to demonstrate a

  considerable amount of learning on their own. Expect to hear back in two

  business days after the interview.
