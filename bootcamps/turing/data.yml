description: !!python/unicode 'Turing is not a bootcamp. It is a seven-month, full-time
  training program to

  turn driven students into professional developers. Turing is the brainchild of

  Jeff Casimir and Jumpstart Lab (you might recognize these names from Hungry

  Academy and gSchool, among other achievements). Students participate in the

  program full time with 40 hours a week of class and lab time and an additional

  20-30 hours a week spent on homework. The program is divided into four six

  week modules with an intermission week between each module in order to allow

  students to absorb and process the knowledge they gain during the course of

  each module.


  The staff at Turing emphasizes their educational experience, not just their

  years as developers, and promises that successful graduates of the school will

  be valuable contributors to the company they choose to work for. The Turing

  curriculum is deep and grounded in solid pedagogy. The instructors are all

  experienced classroom teachers who care about the future of their students.


  The application process is rolling, and requires a resume, writing sample,

  video response, and logic challenge. Students in the Turing program will learn

  TDD with Ruby, Ruby Web Applications with Sinatra & Rails, Professional Web

  Applications, and High-Performance Applications with APIs and Services.
