reviews:
- The most valuable skills we learn there teach us how to teach ourselves.
- Other programs/bootcamps typically run 9-12 weeks. Epicodus is 17! Because of this we’re able to learn more languages, tools (like Git) and really develop good coding habits (like test-driven development).
- I can’t think of a better way to learn than by actually coding day in and day out with other aspiring developers and a knowledgeable instructor to guide you.
