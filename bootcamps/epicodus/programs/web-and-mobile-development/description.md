Epicodus is nothing like a traditional classroom: it's 100% hands-on, building
projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lectures, breakout
sessions, lightning talks, or anything like that. The best way to learn coding
is to code, and that's what Epicodus students spend their time on.

All Epicodus bootcamp instructors are Epicodus graduates themselves, and offer
their experience and knowledge during a 25-week intensive in Portland, Oregon.
Another unique feature is that within reason, students can design their own
tracks and also complete an internship for bootcamp credit. Popular topics
include Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, .NET, Java, Android, PHP, Design, and Drupal.
