description: !!python/unicode "Epicodus bills itself as \"a vocational school for\
  \ aspiring programmers\".\nIts students typically take four five-week classroom\
  \ courses, do two weeks\nof job and internship prep, and finish their studies with\
  \ a five-week internship.\nTuition is $4,800.\n\nEpicodus is serious about applicants\n\
  demonstrating teamwork and having tried programming before attending. They are\n\
  the core components of their application and the reason why is apparent\nthroughout\
  \ their curriculum. Like many other bootcamps, they prefer that you\nhave tried\
  \ to learn to code before. They want to make sure that you know what\nyou are getting\
  \ into. They think it's in your best interest and we agree!\n\nEach week students\
  \ should expect to spend some time (they say about 20-40 min)\non the weekend watching\
  \ videos from a curriculum created by Epicodus. These\nvideos introduce the concepts\
  \ that you will be using in the upcoming week. \n\nAside from this video curriculum,\
  \ you should expect to spend all of your in-\nclass time pair programming.\nWell,\
  \ aside from a 5-10 minute stand up at the beginning of each day to\ndiscuss any\
  \ insights from the past day. While this may seem inconsequential,\nmany development\
  \ teams use this tactic to kick off a day of work on a project\nand its great to\
  \ get in the habit as a beginner.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the Epicodus\
  \ bootcamp is the\ninternship. For the last 5 weeks of the program, students intern\
  \ with software\ncompanies to learn how development works in the real world. Participating\n\
  employers come in all types, sizes, and missions: they've had employers range\n\
  from a one-person startup to a Fortune 100 company to a non-profit.\n\nIf you apply\
  \ through [this link](http://www.epicodus.com/apply/?utm_source=bootcamp-finder)\
  \ and specify that you found out about the school through Bootcamp Finder, you will\
  \ receive a $150 scholarship directly towards your tuition. Before applying, make\
  \ sure that you have thoroughly read Epicodus' website and FAQ's.\n"

    description: !!python/unicode 'Epicodus is nothing like a traditional classroom:
      it''s 100% hands-on, building

      projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lectures, breakout

      sessions, lightning talks, or anything like that. The best way to learn coding

      is to code, and that''s what Epicodus students spend their time on.


      All Epicodus bootcamp instructors are Epicodus graduates themselves, and offer

      their experience and knowledge during a 25-week intensive in Portland, Oregon.

      Another unique feature is that within reason, students can design their own

      tracks and also complete an internship for bootcamp credit. Popular topics

      include Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, .NET, Java, Android, PHP, Design, and Drupal.
