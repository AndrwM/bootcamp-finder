Epicodus bills itself as "a vocational school for aspiring programmers".
Its students typically take four five-week classroom courses, do two weeks
of job and internship prep, and finish their studies with a five-week internship.
Tuition is $4,800.

Epicodus is serious about applicants
demonstrating teamwork and having tried programming before attending. They are
the core components of their application and the reason why is apparent
throughout their curriculum. Like many other bootcamps, they prefer that you
have tried to learn to code before. They want to make sure that you know what
you are getting into. They think it's in your best interest and we agree!

Each week students should expect to spend some time (they say about 20-40 min)
on the weekend watching videos from a curriculum created by Epicodus. These
videos introduce the concepts that you will be using in the upcoming week. 

Aside from this video curriculum, you should expect to spend all of your in-
class time pair programming.
Well, aside from a 5-10 minute stand up at the beginning of each day to
discuss any insights from the past day. While this may seem inconsequential,
many development teams use this tactic to kick off a day of work on a project
and its great to get in the habit as a beginner.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the Epicodus bootcamp is the
internship. For the last 5 weeks of the program, students intern with software
companies to learn how development works in the real world. Participating
employers come in all types, sizes, and missions: they've had employers range
from a one-person startup to a Fortune 100 company to a non-profit.
