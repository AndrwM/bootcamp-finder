reviews:
- The network from Startup Institute, between founders we’ve met and my fellow classmates, rivals that of business school in a fraction of the time and price.
- I did everything from the learning mentioned above to learning security, Amazon Web Services, and white boarding algorithms. I don't feel like I'm a great Rails dev yet but that will come with time.
- We’re relying on each other–sharing skills, offering advice, making connections, and forging friendships.
