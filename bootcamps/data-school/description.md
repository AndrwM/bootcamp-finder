Data School is run by Kevin Markham, a former lead instructor for General Assembly's data science course. In his experience as a teacher, Markham has trained other data science instructors along with dozens of students. With a focus on Python, Data School's main course dives deep into machine learning.

Targeted to an audience of people new to the field, the course seeks to make Python coding accessible, while still diving deep into complex data analysis. According to Markham, his mission in creating Data School is: "I love to teach data science, and I created Data School after finding that most data science educational resources are inaccessible to people new to the field. Thus, I strive to make my resources accessible to data scientists at all levels of knowledge and experience."
