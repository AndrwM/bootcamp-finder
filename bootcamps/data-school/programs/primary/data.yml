reviews:
- "Kevin Markham's Data School courses are remarkably good. Kevin has the ability to simplify complicated concepts and explain not only how to code, but also the 'why' behind it. I have been very happy with the cost and quality of the courses and have learned more in 4 weeks than the 18 months of coursework I've taken from a leading university."
- "Kevin's courses are focused and coherent. Tools learned each week build upon and complement one another, and the classes culminate with a larger-scale project that shows how what you've learned can come together. I learned a great deal, and highly recommend Data School to those looking to explore machine learning tools in greater depth."
