  Development. Expect to

  start learning even before the first day of the bootcamp. You will be asked to

  complete 50+ hours of prework before starting either program. You can see the

  prework online to get a feel for it. As

  a caveat, expect to pay a little bit extra outside of tuition to complete the

  pre-work.


  Both programs are full-time and are broken out into three units. The first

  unit teaches you fundamentals. Expect to learn these fundamentals by doing

  lots of pair programming and

  group programming (though there may be some solo pieces in the iOS class). The

  second unit consists of building projects to reinforce the fundamentals. The

  final piece is either a specialization in the Web Development course or a

  Capstone Project in the iOS course. Specialization simply refers to picking

  something you want to master and going for it. The Capstone project is working

  with a team to build an app for a startup. In addition to just teaching the

  language, Flatiron School teaches you best practices and gets you integrated

  with the tech community. They fundamentally believe that you should learn how

  to learn, not just learn a skill.


  They are also very passionate about providing the highest quality curriculum.

  All of their teachers have all been TA''s with their program first. They also

  take 4-6 weeks in between sessions to work on teacher training and curriculum

  development.


  Admission for the school is done on a rolling basis so the earlier you apply

  the better.
