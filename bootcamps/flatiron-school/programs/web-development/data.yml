reviews:
- Avi knows his stuff and as such, for non-experienced programmers, you should embrace the course to listen to him explain the theory and concept in which why and how Ruby and Rails interact within one another.
- In Rails, I feel like I now know what its metaprogramming is creating and why itâ€™s beneficial. I feel like I can actually use this stuff.
- Avi's teaching style is that of a seasoned, enthusiastic practitioner, and his excitement for programming and teaching shines through in your interactions with him.
