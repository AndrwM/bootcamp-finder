description: !!python/unicode 'The Software Craftsmanship Guide does double duty when
  it comes to teaching

  code. They currently offer two tracks of learning, .Net/C# and Java. They

  consider these to be the two most employable language skills in the current

  market. Although they do have two different tracks, they do point out that

  there are language fundamental and User Interface skills that overlap both

  tracks.


  They do believe in immersive learning. Though the only required hours are 9 am

  to 4 pm when mentors are at the school, the building itself is open 24 hours a

  day to provide even the most enthusiastic students the opportunity to keep

  coding the night away. It''s also not a stretch for you to be working on your

  coding skills during the weekend. You are even welcomed with open arms after

  you graduate.


  You can apply online for this bootcamp, and they should reach out to you

  within a business day. They will schedule an hour long interview which will

  involve a Q&amp;A; session with a mentor and then a programming assessment

  test. Relax, it isn''t a test on what you know about the programming languages.

  However, you will need to demonstrate some fundamental programming skills like

  logic, reasoning, pattern matching and basic algebra (think math section of

  the SATs).


  They really do welcome you with open arms. If you aren''t from the area (or if

  you just want a truly immersive experience) they have limited sponsored

  housing. While they don''t promise a view, they do mention that furniture will

  be included.


  While their employee network is largely regional, they do understand that

  people attend their bootcamp from out of town and work with some recruiters to

  find you gigs out of state.
