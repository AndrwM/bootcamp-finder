reviews:
- Whenever recruiters look at my resume now, they are amazed by how intensive the training was and how much I know.
- At the Guild, we have been taught skills that allow us to become language agnostic developers in the future. I could now self-study another programming language because I understand some of the basic concepts.
- Eric is invested in your success. He spends every hour of class (35 hours a week) with his students. He is available at all hours to take questions via skype or email. Overall I like him a lot.
