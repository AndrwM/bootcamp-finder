description: !!python/unicode 'Hackbright is a bootcamp that focuses on teaching Python
  and only accepts

  women into their cohorts. Its a double whammy of uniqueness in coding

  bootcamps. Their goal is to change what they call the "Dave-to-Girl" ratio by

  enabling women to enter the software development industry.


  Hackbright prefers to teach by maximizing hands on experience and minimizing

  lecture time. As part of that hand on experience, you should expect to spend a

  lot of time pair programming.

  They also have a Career Day at the end of the program to do some speed-

  interviewing.


  Hackbright has a unique mentorship program for all of their fellowship

  students. You will be matched up with 3 mentors who are software engineers

  from leading companies in the the industry such as Twitter, Google, Pinterest,

  Hipmunk, Twilio, and other startups.


  To apply, you need to create an account on their site and create a video. Just

  make sure to reserve time for it. There are two application deadlines as well,

  an early and regular, so make sure to factor that into your application

  planning.
