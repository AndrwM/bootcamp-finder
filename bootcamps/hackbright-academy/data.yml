description: !!python/unicode "Hackbright is a bootcamp that focuses on teaching Python and only accepts women into their cohorts. It's a double whammy of uniqueness in coding bootcamps. Their goal is to increase female representation in tech through education, mentorship, and community.

Hackbright aims to provide a curated subset of classic undergraduate computer science offerings, combined with hands-on teaching of concepts relevant for modern web application development. As part of this accelerated experience, you should expect to spend a lot of time pair programming. Students are given the opportunity to speed-interview with tech companies at the end of the program.

Hackbright has a unique mentorship program for all of their fellowship students. You will be matched up with at least 2 mentors who are software engineers from leading companies in the industry such as Amazon, Eventbrite, Uber, Slack, New Relic, and more.

To apply, you need to create an account on their site and complete an application and coding challenge. Just make sure to reserve time for it.

    description: "All types of engineering fields are traditionally male-dominated, so Hackbright Academy in San Francisco is a 12-week all women's bootcamp. The program says they graduate more female software engineers each year than both Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley. One of the features of Hackbright Academyâ€™s program is that students are given the opportunity to speed-interview with tech companies at the end of the program."
