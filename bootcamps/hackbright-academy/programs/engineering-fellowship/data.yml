reviews:
- When you finish Hackbright, you will be an engineer. You will be able to create things that otherwise you never would. Many companies will find this skill to be very valuableâ€¦ if you want a job, you'll be able to find one.
- Our group became great friends and plan to stay in touch. If you are wondering about job readiness, a few people in our class have already gotten job offers and others are in the process.
- Hackbright is definitely a worthy investment if you want to become a Software Engineer and join one of the best communities for women in technology.
