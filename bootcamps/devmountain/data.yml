description: !!python/unicode 'DevMountain''s mission is to deliver the most impactful
  coding education

  in a way that is both accessible and affordable. A small percentage of

  people can afford to quit their jobs for three months, relocate to another

  state, and pay huge sums of money in order to learn to code. That''s why

  the majority of DevMountain''s courses are offered in an after-hours format

  so that students can maintain a full-time job while attending. They also

  have full-time courses as well, in order to meet the needs of some of

  learners who want to go all-in on programming in an immersive environment.


  DevMountain offers courses in both Web Development and iOS Development.

  Their Web Development course focuses on Javascript as well as HTML, CSS, jQuery,

  AngularJS, Node.js, Firebase, MySQL, Mongodb, and more. Their iOS course

  curriculum is written and taught by iOS developers with their students usually

  progressing far enough to have multiple apps in the store by the end of class.


  All DevMountain instructors and mentors also work full-time as developers and

  are always up to date with the latest trends and technologies. Each

  DevMountain student is assigned a mentor who they can contact at any time to

  get help both in and out of class. Mentors have weekly code reviews with

  students to help them improve and to give them valuable career advice.
