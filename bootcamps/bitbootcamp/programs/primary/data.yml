reviews:
- The learning is fast but not unreasonable. I have never learned this much development in such a condensed period of time. I have classmates who have never touched code before this program, that can put together substantial apps after just 5 weeks.
- During class we always worked in pairs.  We’d switch every day or two.  And each time we switched, we’d start a new project.  Each app we created taught us a new design principle or framework.
