BitBootCamp's Data Science and Machine Learning program focuses on the problem of scaling large decision-making algorithms. According to them, the problem is no longer creating the right algorithm, but making it run in quickly and accessibly in production. The 8 week program aims to equip you with knowledge needed to produce working decision science algorithms.
