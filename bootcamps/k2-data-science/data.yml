description: !!python/unicode 'K2 Data Science is a part-time, 24-week intensive experience
  that will turn you into a job-ready candidate. Our goal is to create an online classroom
  that replicates in-person bootcamps, but it is available to people who want to study
  while keeping their current job. Online instruction will provide academic theory
  and practical explanations, while assignments and projects will replicate the day-to-day
  work of data analysts and scientists. Students will use real data to build a two-project
  portfolio to present to potential employers. Upon graduating, students will have
  completed rigorous training in machine learning, programming in Python, data wrangling,
  project design, and communication of results.
