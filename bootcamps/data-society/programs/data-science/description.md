Data Societyâ€™s online data science curriculum for analysts provides comprehensive learning modules that students can take at their own pace. Students can watch instructional videos, complete practical exercises, take assessments to earn a certificate, and build a portfolio of data science projects. The program uses only real world data sets and incorporates data cleaning in every module in order to give students a real world experience of executing a data science project or building a predictive model from end-to-end. Students learn not only the theory behind the methods and how to program them in R, they also learn how the algorithms work, why they work and in which situations to apply them.
