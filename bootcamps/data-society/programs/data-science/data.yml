reviews:
- I was a beginner to R and I was able to keep up with the pace, structure, and fully understood the lectures. Data Society has been incredibly supportive by reaching out to me monthly to check in, offering me advice, sharing their experiences, and answering any questions I have had.
- The information was useful for seasoned data users, but also gives managers with no programming experience a better understanding of analytic approaches and ways to incorporate them in various lines of work.
- I have never read or heard any explanations on data mining techniques as accessible and clear as in the Data Society courses.
