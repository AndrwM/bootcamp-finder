description: !!python/unicode 'Founders & Coders are building a community of highly
  skilled women and men who want to improve the world through technology. In the process
  they are going against the status quo - running a free full-time, 16 week bootcamp.


  Their highly effective peer-led model of learning attracts exceptional women and
  men from all over the world. From their last two courses, all but one of their graduates
  is now working as a software developer (the only one who isn''t went back to finish
  their PHD). 36% of their graduates were women.


  Founders & Coders support themselves entirely through voluntary contributions of
  their alumni, placement fees from employers and spin off companies set up by their
  graduates and others involved in their community.
