description: "Codeup provides a unique learning opportunity to its students by being\
  \ one of\nthe few bootcamps to offer classes on the LAMP stack (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP).\n\
  In fact, Codeup developed their program specifically to meet the current needs\n\
  of businesses and they genuinely believe in offering people a second chance at\n\
  a fulfilling career.\n\nPrior to showing up to the bootcamp, students are assigned\
  \ about 80-100 hours\nof pre-work that must be done prior to entering class. The\
  \ pre-work was\ncreated by the Codeup instructors to prepare you to hit the ground\
  \ running on\nthe first day of class.\n\nThe official class time runs Monday to\
  \ Friday 9am to 4pm with additional\nhomework after hours for 12 weeks. You should\
  \ expect class time to consist of\na combination of lectures and hands on activities.\
  \ Codeup values pair\nprogramming so you will often be paired off to complete various\
  \ programming\nexercises. Students will finish the program by spending the last\
  \ 2 to 3 weeks\nworking on a capstone project. This capstone project will be demoed\
  \ to\nCodeup\u2019s 50+ hiring partners during their Demo Day.\n\nCodeup also offer\
  \ optional study halls for about an hour in the mornings and\nlate into the evenings.\
  \ Students are encouraged to take advantage of the study\nhall sessions to reach\
  \ out to teachers for additional help or to tackle more\nadvanced versions of material\
  \ from that day\u2019s lesson. Additionally, guest\nspeakers will be invited a couple\
  \ days each week for brown bag lunches to\nprovide insight into the life of developers\
  \ and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe value that Codeup provides extends beyond their formal\
  \ education\nstructures. Codeup is located in Geekdom, one of the major tech hubs\
  \ of the\nSan Antonio tech and startup community. Geekdom is the largest coworking\
  \ space\nin Texas and is home to over 200 startups, many of whom are hiring partners\n\
  for Codeup. This community of techies and entrepreneurs gives Codeup students\n\
  the ability to network with potential employers during their time at the\nbootcamp\
  \ as well as be a part of a collaborative work environment.\n\nCodeup is very aware\
  \ that many of its students are looking to make a career\ntransition after their\
  \ program and believes they have created the best\nenvironment to prepare for a\
  \ developer role. They back this up with their job\nguarantee. If you don\u2019\
  t find successful job placement within 6 months of\ngraduation, they will refund\
  \ you 50% of your tuition.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have any prior experience to\
  \ apply for Codeup. They describe\ntheir ideal candidate as \u201Cmotivated, smart\
  \ and hireable in every way except\nthey\u2019re lacking programming skills and\
  \ knowledge.\u201D Codeup has rolling\nadmissions so be sure to apply early! If\
  \ you are not from the San Antonio\narea, Codeup can help you with living arrangements\
  \ and other logistics.\n\n"
