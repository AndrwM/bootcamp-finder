reviews:
- Jeff has a pretty intense teaching style that works and is effective, but it is very stressful.
- The environment was very collaborative, with everyone dedicated to helping their classmates and celebrating each othersâ€™ small moments of triumph.
- I have done more programming in one week then I thought possible.
