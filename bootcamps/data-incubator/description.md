The Data Incubator is a Cornell-funded data science school, with several questions that dive deep into the technology and problem-solving skills needed in the data science industry. Building on the notion that data is a major raw material in today's economy, The Data Incubator offers courses for working professionals, students, and experts with MA's and PhD's.

The goal of their open program is to turn amateurs into data scientists. While they do not offer scholarships, one of their core offerings is [The Data Incubator Fellowship](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html), which is cost-subsidized.
