description: !!python/unicode 'CodeCore''s Bootcamp Program culminates in their hiring
  day, and you can see

  this focus throughout the bootcamp. You should expect to be doing a lot of

  pair programming to get you

  building real world projects quickly. On Hiring Day, CodeCore''s employer

  partnership network comes to view the projects you created and potentially

  extend job offers. While they don''t guarantee that you will get a job, they do

  boast that they have a network of 20 hiring partners.


  They host four bootcamps a year and cover a different topic each time. While

  you might see a number of the languages we listed below being taught again,

  don''t be surprised if new languages are added or switched out by the time you

  want to apply. In the past, they have run bootcamps on Python, PHP, Java and

  .NET. While the languages and topics of their bootcamp change, CodeCore''s

  fundamental teaching philosophy does not. They teach you a primary language

  and then provide supplementary languages, skill sets and libraries to provide

  you a practical understanding of the core language.


  As a case in point, their current Ruby Bootcamp doesn''t stop at teaching you

  Ruby on Rails, but also provides a background knowledge of Front End languages

  and Development methodologies. It is probably reasonable to guess that while

  the languages may change, skills taught such as popular

  APIs, User Experience (UX) and agile development methodologies will

  remain somewhat constant.


  They have a great comprehensive application process. You will need to apply on

  their site, have a quick get to know you coffee or phone call, and have a more

  intensive in person or Skype testing session. Oh, and don''t worry about moving

  to Canada, they have partnerships with extended stay hotels in the area so you

  get discounted accommodations.
