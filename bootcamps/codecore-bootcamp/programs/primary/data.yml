reviews:
- From my experience CodeCore will open you up to the world of coding and the possibilities that brings.
- I think it is possible to learn all of these things yourself, but when you are put into a bootcamp atmosphere and are allowed to access proven professionals for guidance and tutoring, it excels that learning immensely.
