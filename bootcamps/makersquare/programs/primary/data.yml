reviews:
- The team here is so committed to adapting and improving, asking for our feedback every day. They act quickly making changes to curriculum and lessons are revised each cohort.
- I would recommend this program to anyone who has been let down by online tutorials and really wants to land a job as a developer.
- Iâ€™m blown away by the feeling I get being in a room full of people with the enthusiasm, determination, and mental dexterity to try new things.
