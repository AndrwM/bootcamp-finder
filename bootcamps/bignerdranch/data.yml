description: "For most kids, their first word was mama or dada. For us, it was programming.\
  \ We've been speaking it ever since\u2014and sharing what we know.\nIn our classes,\
  \ you'll cover a lot of ground in a matter of days. We pack a lot of information\
  \ in our bootcamps\u2014some students have said that a week-long bootcamp with us\
  \ is like a semester in college! Our classes are not for the novice programmer,\
  \ but luckily for you, we have some of the best and most seasoned instructors who\
  \ know how to guide you every step of the way. We'll subject you to the most intensive\
  \ app development course you can imagine, and when you finish, you'll be part of\
  \ an elite corps: the few, the proud, the Nerds. After class, you'll even get access\
  \ to ongoing support from the Big Nerd Ranch community.\nWe offer bootcamps at our\
  \ two Ranch locations in iOS, Android, Front-End web development, Back-End web development,\
  \ Cocoa and mobile design.\n"
