reviews:
- From the moment you arrive for a course to the time you leave, every need is taken care of. The instructors were kind, patient and had great personalities, which is important since youâ€™re spending so much time with them. It really seemed like every little detail was thought of.
- Why would someone spend thousands of dollars on an intense training class when they could simply purchase the book for a small portion of that price? The answer to that question is simple. While anyone could purchase the book and work their way through the various exercises contained within, what's missing is the expert who can quickly answer those inevitable questions that bring progress to a screeching halt.
- An awe-inspiring tornado of intense code enlightenment... By the end of the course, I had gone from a PHP-centric programmer puzzled by the semantics of Objective-C to having an original, working iPhone app prototype on my phone. A year later, I still use and build upon the skills I learned at the Ranch.
