  \ following is the description they submitted, for reference:</strong>\n\nDevschool\
  \ combines an expert-guided, progressive, real world approach to\nteaching software\
  \ and web development. Instead of creating artificial\nhoops, courses and classrooms,\
  \ they focus on having students build real\napplications. Every student builds different\
  \ applications and every student\nhas a different time-line based on their own availability.\n\
  \nDevschool doesn't interview for talent, instead they look for people who\ncan\
  \ demonstrate that they have the drive to put in the hours and effort it\ntakes\
  \ to become a paid programmer. Along with proving you are serious about\nlearning\
  \ to code, you will need to pass the \"no jerk\" test.\n\nYour Instructor will begin\
  \ by filling in all of your 'gaps. You will\nnot just be taught to code, but to\
  \ code with team-mates, and they will even\nfocus on getting you to use your Mac\
  \ like a pro, navigating with the\nkeyboard and writing code in Vim.\n\nTowards\
  \ the end of your private Instructor sessions they will begin\ncoaching you on how\
  \ to hunt for and land paying work as a programmer, how\nto interview, and they\
  \ even help you solve and understand code challenges.\n\nThey offer two courses,\
  \ one in web development which is 50 units (50 one on\nones, 50 groups sessions\
  \ and job assistance) and they are now also offering\na 100 unit software engineer\
  \ course which includes the web development course,\nand goes into languages like\
  \ Haskell and Clojure and Go. Both courses have\nabundant amounts of data structures,\
  \ algorithms and other computer science\ntopics.\n\nThe languages you can learn\
  \ at Devschool include: JavaScript, Ruby, HTML,\nMarkdown, JSON, Haskell, Clojure,\
  \ and Go. They also teach React, Angular,\nRails, Sinatra, relational databases\
  \ like Postgresql and non-relatrional\ndatabses like Mongo.\n\nAt Devschool, you\
  \ graduate when you get a job, you don't graduate and then\nflounder looking for\
  \ a job.\n"
