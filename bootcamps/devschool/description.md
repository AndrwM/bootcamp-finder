Devschool combines an expert-guided, progressive, real world approach to
teaching software and web development. Instead of creating artificial
hoops, courses and classrooms, they focus on having students build real
applications. Every student builds different applications and every student
has a different time-line based on their own availability.

Devschool doesn't interview for talent, instead they look for people who
can demonstrate that they have the drive to put in the hours and effort it
takes to become a paid programmer. Along with proving you are serious about
learning to code, you will need to pass the "no jerk" test.

Your Instructor will begin by filling in all of your 'gaps. You will
not just be taught to code, but to code with team-mates, and they will even
focus on getting you to use your Mac like a pro, navigating with the
keyboard and writing code in Vim.

Towards the end of your private Instructor sessions they will begin
coaching you on how to hunt for and land paying work as a programmer, how
to interview, and they even help you solve and understand code challenges.

They offer two courses, one in web development which is 50 units (50 one on
ones, 50 groups sessions and job assistance) and they are now also offering
a 100 unit software engineer course which includes the web development course,
and goes into languages like Haskell and Clojure and Go. Both courses have
abundant amounts of data structures, algorithms and other computer science
topics.

The languages you can learn at Devschool include: JavaScript, Ruby, HTML,
Markdown, JSON, Haskell, Clojure, and Go. They also teach React, Angular,
Rails, Sinatra, relational databases like Postgresql and non-relatrional
databses like Mongo.

At Devschool, you graduate when you get a job, you don't graduate and then
flounder looking for a job.
