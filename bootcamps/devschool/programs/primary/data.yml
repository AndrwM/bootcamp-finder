reviews:
- Through Codementor, I found Jim and made him my long term mentor through months 2-3 of Dev Bootcamp and I ended up getting a partial refund at DBC and joined the brand new (then) Devschool. I really liked how the curriculum wasn't written out ahead of time when what I wanted to build and learn was anything but static. I would recommend Devschool to anyone who wants to cut through the cruft and really, really learn the skills they will need to build modern web applications.
- I would highly recommend Jim and Devschool for any prospective students out there! I have been a student for about 4 months and have learned a ton. Initially I wanted to find a program to help me transition from IT support to a developer and find a programmer job. I now have that developer job and I owe a big thanks to Devschool for helping me develop the required skills to get it.
- Devschool is Like Being an Intern While Learning
- Devschool trained me, and then got me a job in 7 days!
