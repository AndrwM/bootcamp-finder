reviews:
- Being part of level played a huge role in helping me land the job. After the bootcamp I became a more skillful and confident candidate. Specially during my face to face interviews at IDC, some of my answers to the behavioral questions were based in the Level group projects and the capstone project with Beroomers.
- I really enjoyed being part of the inaugural Northeastern Level Boot camp in Seattleâ€¦The best part of the class was our Capstone Project. It allowed me to use the tools to work on a "real world" business problem with a leading corporation.
- Through the Level program, I've been exposed to the skills that employers are looking for today, and can focus on the tools I'd like to use to advance my career going forward. More importantly, my network has grown to include fellow graduates, industry professionals and Level staff that share similar aspirations and are invested in our mutual success.
