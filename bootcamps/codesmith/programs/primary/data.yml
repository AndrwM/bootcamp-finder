reviews:
- I can say without doubt that you will get a job. I received my first offer after 2 days, and after 2 weeks I accepted another offer for more than I was making in NYC as a consultant.
- I could not have made such a huge career transition to engineering without Codesmith. The teachers and curriculum are top-notch and Codesmith has created a community where people genuinely care for each other through the entire process.
