description: !!python/unicode 'Hack Reactor wants to turn you into a software engineer
  by teaching you CS

  fundamentals, full-stack JavaScript and engineering best practices. Through

  lectures, toy problems and large projects, students learn cutting edge

  technologies, and become adept at teaching themselves new languages, libraries

  and frameworks. Students pair program for much of the course, allowing them to

  learn from one another and fostering crucial communication skills. There are

  also fun activities that happen in the evening like meetups and guest

  speakers.


  At a macro level, you will spend the first six weeks learning basic skills and

  learning the mindset of engineers. The next six weeks are devoted to

  completing a personal project, a short group project and a large group

  project, giving you experience programming like you would at a developer job.

  At the end of the program, there is a demo day to show off your projects to

  potential employers.


  While a coding background isn''t a requirement, requires you to complete an

  admissions coding challenge and a technical interview.
