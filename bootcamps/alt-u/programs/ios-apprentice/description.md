The iOS Apprentice is a week long bootcamp where you will learn the fundamentals of iOS development with the Swift programming language, but more than just that, you will also learn key industry skills for how projects are structured, how code is managed and how to work as part of a team.

You will leverage Swift, the iOS SDK, and Apple developer tools to learn object-oriented programming, design patterns, type systems, functional language features, user interface design, best practices in programming, and problem analysis. At the end of the week you should feel ready and confident to graduate to the Journeyman level courses and explore intern level job opportunities.
