  \ your goal of becoming an expert iOS programmer, bypassing the drudgery of a 4\
  \ year, $100,000+ computer science degree from a traditional university.\n\nAlt-U\u2019\
  s industry-seasoned instructors will teach you and your fellow students everything\
  \ you need to know to start your career in mobile app development. You can choose\
  \ from one of three tiers based on your level of experience and, in an intimate\
  \ classroom setting, you will learn anything from basic concepts, to being part\
  \ of a development team, to advanced programming.\n\nALT-U is presented by Five\
  \ Pack Creative (www.fivepackcreative.com). Five Pack Creative has been building\
  \ beautiful apps since 2008 and desired to share their industry knowledge with other\
  \ developers trying to learn relevant skills in the industry. Their experience and\
  \ adoption of the \u201CSee One, Do One, Teach One\u201D model allows them to train\
  \ the next generation of iOS developers \u2013 that\u2019s you! After you go through\
  \ their iOS bootcamp sessions (which include content from Ray Wenderlich), you should\
  \ be placeable, as an intern, entry-level, intermediate, or senior developer, within\
  \ the industry."
