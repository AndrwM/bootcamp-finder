Alt-U, short for “Alternative University” will help you reach your goal of becoming an expert iOS programmer, bypassing the drudgery of a 4 year, $100,000+ computer science degree from a traditional university.

Alt-U’s industry-seasoned instructors will teach you and your fellow students everything you need to know to start your career in mobile app development. You can choose from one of three tiers based on your level of experience and, in an intimate classroom setting, you will learn anything from basic concepts, to being part of a development team, to advanced programming.

ALT-U is presented by Five Pack Creative (www.fivepackcreative.com). Five Pack Creative has been building beautiful apps since 2008 and desired to share their industry knowledge with other developers trying to learn relevant skills in the industry. Their experience and adoption of the “See One, Do One, Teach One” model allows them to train the next generation of iOS developers – that’s you! After you go through their iOS bootcamp sessions (which include content from Ray Wenderlich), you should be placeable, as an intern, entry-level, intermediate, or senior developer, within the industry.
