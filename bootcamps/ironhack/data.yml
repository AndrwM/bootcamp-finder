description: !!python/unicode 'The folks at Ironhack think that there is more to becoming
  a developer than

  just learning a programming language. Being a developer also means being a

  member of the tech community and that is certainly what Ironhack is doing.

  Ironhack''s unique location in Spain has not only allowed them to be

  participants in but help define the tech community around them. As Spain''s

  tech community is starting to blossom, Ironhack has made it its mission to

  educate university students about career options at startups not just large

  tech companies. Expect that as a student here you will be

  immersed in the local tech flavor and get access to awesome European startups.


  In terms of what they teach, you should expect to get three main things out of

  the course: 1. A solid full-stack knowledge from HTML to Ruby (with some

  coverage of developer tools) 2. An understanding of Agile development and 3.

  Practical experience building real products. Before you arrive, you will get

  2-3 weeks worth of pre-work to prepare you for the in-person program. While on

  their campus, you should expect to spend 90% of your time programming with an

  emphasis on peer programming.


  Your programming will be guided by experienced, capable hands. All of their

  instructors are web developers and their TA has a background in educational

  technology to make sure that the programming knowledge of the instructors is

  passed on to students in a cohesive and sensible way. You will also have

  plenty of personal attention with a maximum of 20 students per cohort.


  Does reading about learning to code tire you out? Ironhack also realizes that

  there is an art to unwinding from a hard week of learning to program. They

  will help you chill out with massage sessions, yoga classes, drinks on

  Fridays, and generally enjoying their prime location in Madrid.


  Ready to get started? There is a three step application process. First, you

  will complete a written application which asks general questions about your

  motivations. Then there will be two subsequent interviews, a fit interview and

  a technical interview to determine your current skills and future potential.

  Also, don''t think you need to know Spanish to apply. All lectures will be held

  in English.
