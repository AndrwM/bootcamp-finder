description: "While there are a number of Ruby on Rails bootcamps in the US, Makers\n\
  Academy's location in London is pretty unique. Other than being located in the\n\
  amazing city of London, they also have a great curriculum and teaching\nmethodology.\
  \ They give you first-hand experience through project based work,\ninvite members\
  \ from the tech community to teach and mingle and most\nimportantly teach you how\
  \ to pair program. They very much stress pair\nprogramming and estimate that 50-70%\
  \ of a students time with them will be\nspent learning this way. In addition to\
  \ the pair programming, you should\nexpect to work on various exercises, projects\
  \ and have end of the week challenges.\n\nThere are also some pretty great perks\
  \ like free coffee, snacks and breakfast\nas well as a loan Macbook to use for the\
  \ duration of the bootcamp.\n\nApplying is simple, just fill out an application\
  \ online. While they don't\nguarantee job placement, they do have partnerships with\
  \ companies in London\nwho visit on the final day of the bootcamp for students seeking\
  \ employment.\n\nMakers Academy offers a \xA3250 scholarship to Remote and Onsite\
  \ students who apply through Bootcamp Finder. Use this <a href=\"https://goo.gl/c1NOhd\"\

    description: "Makers Academy is a fully immersive, 12 week computer programming\
      \ bootcamp. It's like Oxbridge meets the Royal Marines, but for people who want\
      \ to learn to code, and is designed to turn people with no knowledge of web-development\
      \ into job-ready Junior Developers in just 12 weeks. They're Europe\u2019s first\
      \ Developer Bootcamp, running highly selective classes of our offline course\
      \ every 6 weeks, and their Remote course every 12 weeks. They're based in Aldgate\
      \ East, a stone's throw away from London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout.\n\nThey\
      \ take students with little/no experience in programming and teach the fundamentals\
      \ of web development, with the aim of developing in their students the necessary\
      \ skills to prepare them to secure a role as a Junior Developer upon graduation.\
      \ They teach all the latest technologies, like Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, full-stack\
      \ JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Ajax and some of the softer skills like Object-Oriented\
      \ Design, Test Driven Development, Agile Methodology, and version controlling\
      \ with Git. We highly suggest taking a look at their [curriculum\nbreakout](http://www.makersacademy.com/curriculum/)\n\
      \nThey take a \"learn by doing\" approach, delivered through self-directed,\
      \ project-based work. Students are encouraged to work in pairs on practical\
      \ coding challenges, with weekly challenges, culminating in a final project\
      \ which is presented to friends, family and hiring partners on \"Graduation\
      \ Day\". They actively support and mentor our graduates into work, helping set\
      \ up job interviews with their hiring partners. Of the 600+ students who\u2019\
      ve graduated so far, almost everybody who has finished our course with the intention\
      \ of becoming a developer has achieved this within 3 months of graduating.\n"
