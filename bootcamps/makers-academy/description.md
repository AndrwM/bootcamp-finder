While there are a number of Ruby on Rails bootcamps in the US, Makers
Academy's location in London is pretty unique. Other than being located in the
amazing city of London, they also have a great curriculum and teaching
methodology. They give you first-hand experience through project based work,
invite members from the tech community to teach and mingle and most
importantly teach you how to pair program. They very much stress pair
programming and estimate that 50-70% of a students time with them will be
spent learning this way. In addition to the pair programming, you should
expect to work on various exercises, projects and have end of the week challenges.

There are also some pretty great perks like free coffee, snacks and breakfast
as well as a loan Macbook to use for the duration of the bootcamp.

Applying is simple, just fill out an application online. While they don't
guarantee job placement, they do have partnerships with companies in London
who visit on the final day of the bootcamp for students seeking employment.
