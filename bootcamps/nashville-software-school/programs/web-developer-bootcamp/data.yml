reviews:
- The class is worth it for the contacts alone. I did not know anyone in the Nashville tech community and this class has put me in front of some of the best developers and startup people in the city.
- I went from a forty-something guy with an increasingly outdated set of professional tools to having the skills I needed to enter the cutting-edge field of software development.
- Overall it was a great experience, and I can't imagine where I'd be right now without it.
