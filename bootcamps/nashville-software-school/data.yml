description: !!python/unicode 'Nashville Software School more so than many other bootcamps
  is all about

  community. Not just the tech community, but the Nashville tech community. This

  bootcamp is actually a community funded non-profit. Prior to 2014, the

  bootcamp was only available to Nashville residents, so expect to see a lot of

  local flavor, from the students in attendance to their hiring partners.


  The school currently operates two bootcamps: one for Web Development

  Foundations and one for Software Development Foundations (centered around Ruby

  on Rails). Both are open to beginners. They break up their teachings into

  three main categories. You will receive intensive training through online

  tutorials, videos, classroom lectures, pair programming, solo programing,

  group programming and seminar discussions. Throughout this intensive training

  you will also receive mentorship from their staff. Finally, you will also be

  set up with apprenticeships. They work with a number of partner companies to

  provide you with internships and projects to get hands on experience.


  Applying is super straight forward. Fill out the application online, and if

  they are interested they will schedule a video or in-person interview. Expect

  to hear back about if you got an interview within a week and to have the

  actual interview 2-3 weeks after sending in your application. Also good to

  note is that they include a long list of qualification or things they want to

  see in their applicants on their apply page.
