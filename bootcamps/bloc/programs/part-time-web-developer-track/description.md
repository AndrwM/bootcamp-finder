Bloc’s Part-Time Web Developer Track teaches students web development using several technologies: HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. Students can learn to code at their own pace, and are given the option of learning for 27 weeks at 20 hours per week, or 54 weeks at 12 hours per week. Bloc’s curriculum encourages students to build projects based on popular websites. As students learn, they meet regularly with a mentor who helps them understand new concepts and clear up misunderstandings.
