description: "Not surprisingly, Fullstack Academy does exactly what it says it does.\
  \ It\nteaches you the full web development stack. This means that you will learn\
  \ how\nto program the Front End (the website your user would interact with) and\
  \ the\nBack End (the piece on the server which performs all the logic for your site),\n\
  specifically MEAN stack and everything in between (\u221E). Ok, they don't actually\n\
  teach you an infinite amount of knowledge, but it is more comprehensive\ncoverage\
  \ of material than you might see at other bootcamps.\n\nThey are also comprehensive\
  \ in structure. Before you arrive, expect to do a\nsignificant ammount of pre-work\
  \ that helps effectively prepare you for the\ncourse. After the bootcamp, expect\
  \ support to help you find a job including\nmock technical interviews.\n\nWhile\
  \ Fullstack's curriculum is certainly comprehensive when it comes to\nprogramming,\
  \ what is even more impressive is the integration of intangible\nskills throughout\
  \ the course. As part of the learning experience, Fullstack\nencourages its students\
  \ to take advantage of the growing New York tech scene\nand attend the numerous\
  \ MeetUps and Hackathons that take place. Outside of\njust New York, they also encourage\
  \ their students to take part in Open Source\nprojects (often a source of pride\
  \ and credentials for programmers).\n\nThe most obvious way these skills are infused\
  \ into the course is through the\nCTO Program. These are eight\nmodules that teach\
  \ essential CTO skills throughout the program. These modules\ninclude lessons like\
  \ Learning to Learn, Learning to Lead, Learning by\nTeaching, Become the Right Person,\
  \ Real World Experience, Code is a Community,\nInnovation Happens Everywhere, and\
  \ Stackup Support.\n\nThey accept applications online on their site on a rolling\
  \ basis, but expect\nto wait up to a week to hear back if you got an interview or\
  \ not. Prior to the\ninterview, they will provide additional materials to help you\
  \ prepare as well\nas several take-home problem sets. Fullstack Academy currently\
  \ reports 97%\nhiring rate for their students and they take pride in their job placement\n\
  process.\n\n"
