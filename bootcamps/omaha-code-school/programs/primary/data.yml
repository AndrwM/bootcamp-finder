reviews:
- OCS is structured in a very deliberate way. Learn the basics, and then build on top with more advanced topics. 
- The schoolâ€™s philosophy encourages people of all learning styles to work in whatever environment fits them best: even if that means heading to a coffee shop down the street.
- No question or comment is ever too dumb
