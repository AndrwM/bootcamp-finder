description: !!python/unicode 'Anyone Can Learn To Code (ACLTC) is a nights-and-weekends
  web programming

  bootcamp in Chicago that runs for 15 weeks and trains students from all

  backgrounds (including those with no prior programming experience) to become

  web developers capable of landing an entry level position. Many people want to

  jump into web development through a code bootcamp, but simply can''t afford to

  quit their jobs. Our part time program makes this possible for people who live

  near Chicago.


  We train our students in Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, SQL,

  and Git, among other technologies. We also help our students land jobs through

  networking with our partner companies, helping them build an impressive Github

  portfolio, and helping them craft great resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and cover

  letters.


  Our pedagogical approach is to teach every single concept in plain English and

  break down complex technical ideas to make them easy to understand. We don''t

  just hand our students online resources and exercises and wait for them to

  approach us when they get stuck. We''ll actually be switching back and forth

  between interactive instruction and hands on exercises. For example, the

  teacher will explain a new concept in depth for 30 minutes, and during the

  following hour, the students will complete a guided hands-on programming

  exercise to help crystalize that concept.


  This approach helps our students absorb and understand the material in the

  shortest possible time, as well as give them a deeper understanding of the

  concepts than if they had just read an article on the topic. Our "plain

  English" instruction can be sampled with our free Ruby screencasts:

  ACLTC is committed to helping you learn how to think like a programmer and

  develop the skills necessary to land your first development job.
