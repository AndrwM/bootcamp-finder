  \ design,\ndesign theory, jQuery, JavaScript and WordPress, plus all of the skills\
  \ you\nneed to run your own freelance business. To create the curriculum, the\n\
  HackerYou team collaborated with developer Ahmed Omran. In addition to his\ndeveloper\
  \ background, he has a great background in education and\ndocumented the thought\
  \ that went into designing the HackerYou educational\nexperience.\n\nThe program\
  \ runs for nine weeks, during which you\u2019ll be at HackerYou HQ five\ndays a\
  \ week from about 10 am to 6 pm. The program has over 360 hours of class\ntime where\
  \ you will learn through hundreds of exercises, a major project\nassignment each\
  \ week and an educational thread focused on helping you to\ndevelop the skills you\u2019\
  ll need to succeed as a freelancer. You will also get\ngreat personal attention.\
  \ There are three instructors per course and a cap of\n25 students.\n\nThe application\
  \ process begins with an online application. Next, you can\nexpect an in-person\
  \ or Skype video interview with Heather Payne, HackerYou's\nfounder and CEO. She'll\
  \ chat with you to determine if HackerYou is a mutual\nfit. Next, you'll receive\
  \ some case study questions meant to highlight the\nrealities of life as a freelancer.\
  \ Once returned, the HackerYou team will\ndiscuss your application and decide as\
  \ a team to offer you a conditional\nacceptance. The acceptance becomes official\
  \ upon your completion of the pre-\ncourse work and submitting a three-item portfolio\
  \ of websites you've built.\n\nHackerYou was founded by the team who introduced\
  \ Ladies Learning\nCode in 2011, and to date it is the only\nprogramming bootcamp\
  \ in existence founded and run by women. So, although it's\nco-ed, typically 70%\
  \ of students are female. It's a great bootcamp for those\nwho appreciate diversity\
  \ and are looking for a social and collaborative\nenvironment.\n"
