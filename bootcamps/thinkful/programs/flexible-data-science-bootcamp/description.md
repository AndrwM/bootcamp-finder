Thinkful's data science bootcamp is driven by 1-on-1 mentorship. By working closely with a mentor, students can learn the topics they need to get a job. That includes Python, its math libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, and mathematical modeling using linear algebra and statistics. By using these industry tools and knowledge sets, Thinkful students can get ahead with a mentor-personalized experience. Students meet with their mentor three times a week for an hour each session, providing students with best practices and constant code review.
