Thinkful's data science bootcamp is driven by 1-on-1 mentorship. Students learn the skills they need to get a job by working closely with a professional data scientist. That includes programming in Python, related Python packages for analysis, modeling, and machine learning like NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn; plus data visualization tools like matplotlib, seaborn, and Jupyter. Thinkful students get ahead with a mentor-personalized experience, customizing their learning path and focusing on the skills they need. Students meet with their mentor three times a week for an hour each session to learn best practices, receive constant feedback, and move quickly.
