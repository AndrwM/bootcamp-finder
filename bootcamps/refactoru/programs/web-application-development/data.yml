reviews:
- For my first job, I got hired to build an enterprise-ready version of an application that I did as part of my coursework at RefactorU.
- RefactorU provided an amazing learning environment where I was inspired by both the knowledge and passion of the instructors, as well as the drive and intelligence of my fellow students.
- RefactorU was an amazing experience and I learned everything I needed to a successful web developer.
