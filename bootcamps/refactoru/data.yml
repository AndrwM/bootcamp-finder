description: "RefactorU\u2019s mission is to accelerates the learning and development\
  \ of the\nworld's aspiring creatives, makers, and technologists. RefactorU\u2019\
  s web\ndevelopment bootcamp focuses on full stack JavaScript/Node.JS. You can check\n\
  out more about why they went with the rapidly growing Javascript/Node.JS combo\n\
  in their FAQ section under \"Why are you not teaching Ruby on Rails?\".\n\nBefore\
  \ you get started on their campus, expect 40-50 hours of instructional\npre-work\
  \ before the bootcamp. When you are at RefactorU\u2019s web development\nbootcamp,\
  \ you will be taught by 1-2 lead instructors with a team of 1-4 TAs.\nThere is a\
  \ max of 24 students per class so the student to teacher ratio\naverages around\
  \ 6:1.\n\nAs much as possible, they minimize the lecturing portion of the bootcamp\
  \ to\nfocus on hands-on experience, pair programming, and peer groups. No day is\n\
  typical, but in general you can expect to be in class by around 8:30am. At\naround\
  \ 9am, instructors will introduce the topic of the day. There may be a\nshort lecture\
  \ followed by some class exercises to get you working on applying\nthe new topic.\
  \ You then hack away until lunch, working individually or within\nsmall groups.\
  \ Instructors help with specific questions and facilitate team\ndiscussions.\n\n\
  Afternoons are similar to mornings, although nearly each week there\u2019s a\nspecial\
  \ guest speaker or new activity. The \u201Cofficial\u201D day wraps up at around\n\
  6pm, but students often stay later. Prior to that, students will meet with\ntheir\
  \ peer groups to reflect on what went well.\n\nThere are typically nightly events\
  \ held either at RefactorU or at nearby\ncompanies. These events include weekly\
  \ guest speakers and special events like\ntrips to local sights and companies. You\
  \ can apply online. There are a few\nrounds of deadlines for the bootcamp: a rolling\
  \ decisions deadline, an early\napplication deadline and a final app deadline. The\
  \ moral of the story: apply\nearly. Also, make sure to save some time for the optional\
  \ programming question.\nWhile it is optional, they HIGHLY suggest that you give\
  \ it a shot.\n"
