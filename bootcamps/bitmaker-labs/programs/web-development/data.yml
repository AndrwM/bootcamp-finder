reviews:
- Personally I had a great experience at Bitmakers. I was in the first cohort and I learnt a great deal about creating web applications with Rails. I was lucky when graduating I had a few job opportunities spring up.
- The team at Bitmaker was super supportive and Sean was especially helpful in vetting our application and improving our chances via other means.
- The best part about bitmaker is immersing yourself in the tech community, experiencing the completion of difficult goals amongst like-minded individuals, and sparking your inner programmer/entrepreneur.
