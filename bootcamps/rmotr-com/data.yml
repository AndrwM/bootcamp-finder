    description: !!python/unicode 'Our "Advanced Python Programming" is great for
      developers that want to move their Python knowledge to the next level. It''s
      not intended for beginner coders, because many of the basic concepts are going
      to be taken for granted. You will jump directly into the most advanced Python
      topics, and also get a full immersion into Web applications development with
      the Flask framework.

      You will be learning HTTP concepts, and you will write and entire RESTful API
      as part of this course.

      The program aims to teach you things that you won''t find in most of the common
      resources, like: good practices based on experience, conventions, most used
      tools, etc.

    description: !!python/unicode 'Our "Introduction to Python Programming" is a great
      choice for beginners developers. You will be learning a strong foundation of
      concepts that will allow you grow as a professional coder. Even though it''s
      focused in the Python programming language, concepts acquired in this course
      will let you jump to pretty much any other technology.

      It includes a solid explanation of Object Oriented Programming concepts, and
      many other industry standard good practices and tools.
