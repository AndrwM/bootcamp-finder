reviews:
- Working on a team for three weeks is actual, real-life work experience that we’re getting in the classroom, and that’s something that universities totally miss. I felt lost when I graduated from college, but this program helps a lot.
- The way Mobile Makers integrates you, they not only teach you, they teach you how to figure out problems using external resources like CocoaPods, Stack Overflow and the Apple Documentation.
- The great lectures combined with constant practice of the concepts building on each other was very effective. However don’t come unprepared with 0 coding experience. If you’re struggling to get the basics, you won’t get as much out of the course.
